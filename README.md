metagene: A package to produce metagene plots
========================================================

This package produces metagene plots to compare the behavior of DNA-interacting proteins at selected groups of genes/features. Bam files are used to increase the resolution. Multiple combination of group of bam files and/or group of genomic regions can be compared in a single analysis. Bootstraping analysis is used to compare the groups and locate regions with statistically different enrichment profiles.
